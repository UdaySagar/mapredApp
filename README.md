# mapredApp
Implement custom writable to treat the STATE:CITY pair as input. 
Implement Reducer to count the number of time a STATE:CITY pair has occurred in the file

1. Input file has two columns of data (STATE, CITY) seperated by ':'

Navigate to mapredApp/input/input.txt

2. Implement custom writable to treat the STATE:CITY pair as input



3. Implement Reducer to count the number of time a STATE:CITY pair has occurred in the file




4. Implement a Combiner with same logic as of Reducer
