# mapredApp
Implement custom writable to treat the STATE:CITY pair as input. 
Implement Reducer to count the number of time a STATE:CITY pair has occurred in the file

1. Input file has two columns of data (STATE, CITY) seperated by ':'

Navigate to mapredApp/input/input.txt

2. Implement custom writable to treat the STATE:CITY pair as input

Go to src/main/java/customwritable/colonSepWritable.java

3. Implement Reducer to count the number of time a STATE:CITY pair has occurred in the file

Go to src/main/java/mapredApp


4. Implement a Combiner with same logic as of Reducer


Go to src/main/java/mapredApp
